            <h3>Stress Relief Tips</h3>

            <p>Here are five tips that can help relieve stress on a daily basis.</p>

            <img class="sec_img" src="images/break.jpg"
                alt="Break"
                height="150"
                width="150">

            <h4>Take a break from what you're doing.</h4>

            <p>
                Maybe it's hard to get away from a big work project, a crying baby or a growing credit 
                card bill. But give yourself permission to step away from it for a short time. Don't avoid 
                your stressors (those bills have to be paid sometime), but take a few minutes for yourself.
            </p>

            <img class="sec_img" src="images/exercise.jpg"
                alt="Exercise"
                height="150"
                width="150">

            <h4>Exercise on a Daily Basis</h4>

            <p>
                Exercise is a huge part of being healthy, and it benefits your mind as well as your body. 
                It doesn't have to be an hour a day; even a 20-minute walk in the midst of a stressful 
                time can give you an immediate effect that can last for several hours.
            </p>

            <img class="sec_img" src="images/smile.jpg"
            alt="Smile"
            height="150"
            width="150">

            <h4>Take Time to Smile and Laugh</h4>

            <p>
                When people are stressed, they often hold a lot of the stress in their face. Laughs and 
                smiles can help relieve some of that tension and improve the situation. And if you share 
                your smile with someone else, it will them release some of their tension too!
            </p>

            <img class="sec_img" src="images/support.jpg"
            alt="Support"
            height="150"
            width="150">

            <h4>Get support from family and friends</h4>

            <p>
                Call a friend, send an email. Sharing your concerns does help relieve stress. But pick a 
                person who you feel can understand you. If your co-workers are the stressors, it probably 
                won't alleviate your stress if you share your worries over credit card bills with one of 
                them.
            </p>

            <img class="sec_img" src="images/meditate.jpg"
            alt="Meditate"
            height="150"
            width="150">

            <h4>Meditate</h4>

            <p>
                Meditation helps the mind and body to relax and focus. When meditating, people can release 
                emotions that may have been causing the body physical stress. Research has shown that even 
                meditating briefly can reap immediate benefits.
